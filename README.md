# MergeSortPthreads
This code is part of an assigment for Operating Systems - Fall 2022.
This code compares the time that it takes to sort an array of n elements
by a normal implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm and its threaded version.

NOTE: To modify the array's size or the number of threads please do it in the Struct.h file.
